# AES-Cryptography-App
A console application is written with C programming language for encrypting/decrypting text files by Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

### Library
using [kokke/tiny-AES-c](https://github.com/kokke/tiny-AES-c) implementation of the AES ECB, CTR and CBC encryption algorithms written in C.

### Prerequisites
C compiler. ex: gcc, The GNU Compiler Collection.

### Running Test
- compile crypto.c file 
- press "e" => encryption , "d" => decraption
- enter the file.txt name. ex: test.txt.
- enter the key file name. ex: key.txt.
##### output:
- encryption => test.txt_encrypted.txt.
- decraption => test.txt_edecrypted.txt
