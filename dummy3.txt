@ Magnus: The standard defines sizeof as yielding the number of bytes in the object and that sizeof (char) is always one. The number of bits in a byte is implementation specific. Edit: ANSI C++ standard section 5.3.3 Sizeof: "The sizeof operator yields the number of bytes in the object representation of its operand. [...] sizeof (char), sizeof (signed char) and sizeof (unsigned char) are 1; the result of sizeof applied to any other fundamental type is implementation-defined.
